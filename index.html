         When we speak of training we are talking about speed, strength, power, and sports therapy.</p>

      <div class="about__parag">
        <div>
          <p class="about__text">We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.</p>
          <p class="about__text">ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane
            metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's
              a way of life. Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just 
              looking and feeling better - we're here for you! </p>
          <p class="about__text">ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal
            training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and
              are second to none – all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements. </p>
          <p class="about__text">We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world
            does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing.
            We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to
            look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants
            hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude
            is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.</p>
          <p class="about__text">We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!</p>
          <p class="about__text">We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike
            other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a
            cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our
            clubs. </p>
