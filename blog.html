        <p class="about__text">Motivation is the foundation of all athletic effort and accomplishment. Without your desire
         and determination to improve your sports performances, all of the other mental factors, confidence, intensity, focus,
         and emotions, are meaningless. To become the best athlete you can be, you must be motivated to do what it takes to maximize
         your ability and achieve your goals. Motivation, simply defined, is the ability to initiate and persist at a task.
          To perform your best, you must want to begin the process of developing as an athlete and you must be willing to maintain
         your efforts until you have achieved your goals. Motivation in sports is so important because you must be willing to work
         hard in the face of fatigue, boredom, pain, and the desire to do other things. </p>

        <p class="about__text">Reserve ½ teaspoon of them in a small bowl. Add the brown rice to the seeds in the pan with a pinch of salt
            and 300ml of boiling water. Bring to the boil, stir once, cover and cook over a very low heat for 25 minutes or until
           the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. In a bowl, mix the cornflour and tamari to a paste, then mix in the
            rest of the sauce ingredients plus 3 tablespoons of cold water, and set aside. When you’re ready to cook your stir-fry,
            heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan. Add the spring onions and peppers, and stir-fry over a high heat for
            2 minutes before adding the mangetout and garlic. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the prawns and bamboo shoots. Stir the
            sauce and add to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to coat – if
            it’s looking too thick, add a splash more water. Stir a few drops of sesame oil into the cooked rice and serve with the
            stir-fry, with the reserved sesame seeds sprinkled on top.</p>
